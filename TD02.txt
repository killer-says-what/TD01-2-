I think it's time
For you to know

Big cat (uh, oh)
Space Nazis, Robert Stack (uh, oh)
God damn it, gonna snap (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Leonard Nimoy, call me back (call me back)
I try to call you every day
I'm rehearsing what to say
When the truth comes out (of my very own mouth)
I've been working on a unified theory
If I make it through tonight everybody's gonna hear me out
'Cause I'm the right one
On my touch-tone, touch-tone telephone
I'm the only one
On your A.M., A.M. Radio
Oh, I'm crying now
Authentic tears
They flow out of me when I think about you
'Cause you're the only person in the world who'd understand
'Cause you're the only person in the world who'd understand the meaning of this
Oh, my God
I try and I try and I try (to make you listen to me)
I try to call you everyday
I'm rehearsing what to say
When the truth comes out (of my very own mouth)
I've been working on a unified theory

And like you, I'm a genius before my time

Pretty soon they'll discover me
In the Super-Sargasso Sea
I try to call you everyday
What can I say?

CABINET MAN:

The day they found me, I hadn't yet been played
Inside my workshop behind the old arcade
Electric desires had unraveled all my wires
Now I'm in the box for safekeeping
The news reporters reported that I died
But all my organs were living on inside
Circuit board to brain with two lungs collecting change
One big human heart gently beeping
You can't win me, I can't be beat
I won't hurt you unless you cheat
You can't see me behind the screen
I'm half human and half machine
Thank God for business, they let me take the floor
I stood so proudly, like I was going to war
Players soon appeared and I quickly was revered
This must be what love would have felt like
Such dedication, they came from miles away
With eyes so piercing, they'd wait their turn to play
Perfect patient lines because I was in their minds
I could do whatever I felt like (whatever I felt like)
You can't win me, I can't be beat
I won't hurt you unless you cheat
You can't see me behind the screen
I'm half human and half machine
I'm happy for years and years
And, only eating the occasional maintenance man
Only driving a few kids to madness
Maybe they were predisposed to madness, who knows?
I only want to have fun
But now they're telling me my days here are done
'Cause there's a tiny little box that they make in Japan
And pretty soon it's gonna fit in your hand
It's getting lonely, it's getting hard to breathe
The arcade's empty, I think it's Christmas Eve
Someone's broken in, now they're painting on my skin
Breaking me and taking my quarters
Bashing in my face with a crowbar
Kicking me and pushing me over
Now they see my blood on their sneakers
You can't win me, I can't be beat
I won't hurt you unless you cheat
You can't see me behind the screen
I'm half human and half machine

NO EYED GIRL:

Oh, knowing what we know, knowing what we don't know
This is gonna change our world
Feeling how I feel, I'll accept the unreal
If you'd be my no-eyed girl
From nowhere mankind can go
There's too much light, blinding white
Your matter tells mine to scatter
It's alright, it's alright
From the moment that we met
I've been awake like I've never been awake in all my life
If I spoke your language, I could tell you how I feel
But your language isn't real
In every myth, there's a little bit of truth
But I cannot say a thing
I cannot say a thing
Without proof, oh, no
Knowing what we know, knowing what we do not know
This is gonna change our world
I might go insane if I learn your full name
If you'd be my no-eyed girl
From nowhere mankind can go
There's too much light, blinding white
Emotions, human implosions
It's alright, it's alright
Right before the kiss, I noticed something in the air
Molecules existed when there should have been none there
Chemical reactions with the surface of your skin
Some will say my actions let the no-eyed people in
And I'd do it all again
And I'd do it all again
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And I'd do it all again
And I'd do it all again
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

WHEN HE DIED:

When he died
Turns out he left behind
A mansion full of other people's skulls
The odd thing is, they never found his own when he died
When he died
He somehow left behind
Strange symbols on the floor beneath his corpse
Investigators said the wood was scorched when he died
When he died
They found so many scorpions inside his lungs
When he died
The statues of his missing children cried
What was later found to be his blood
When he died (on a dark and stormy night)
They telephoned his wife (who reacted with delight)
But gradually her voice began to fade to nothing
And the laughing record played, the laughing record played
When he died
They found a message etched into his spine
That said when he died
An endless age of untold nightmares would be nigh
And the blood would make the seas run red
When he died (on a dark and stormy night)
A nearby shed caught fire (it simply caught alight)
And when they cleared the charred wood from the ground
Inside they found a painting of a clown (a creepy painting of a clown)
He'd painted it when he was just a child
But scrawled upon the back was exactly when he died
When he died
When he died
When he died
When he died

SWEET BOD:

Your body is so sweet now, baby
I'm saying trick or treat now
You know I've got to have you, yeah
You sexy sweet cadaver
All wrapped up like a mummy (ooh-ooh)
I'll cover you in honey
And wait a hundred years or so (oh-whoa, oh, oh)
You know, you know it isn't sexual (it isn't sexual)
Strictly confectional (strictly confectional)
Strictly medicinal (strictly medicinal)
If a little nontraditional
I'm digging up your coffin
And pouring out the contents
Your sexy sweet solution
Is prime for distribution
Sweet bod
Your body's starting rumors
Of Mason jars of sweetness
Whose satisfied consumers
Have often claimed to witness
Some sexy shrinking tumors, oh
A sweet return to fitness
They're just a hundred bucks or so (oh-whoa, oh, oh)
You know, you know it isn't sexual (it isn't sexual)
Strictly professional (strictly professional)
Entrepreneurial (entrepreneurial)
Oh, and what a sweet memorial
I'm digging up your coffin
And pouring out the contents
Good God, I'm glad to see you
Won't you be my panacea?
Sweet bod
Sweet bod
Oh, sweet bod
Sweet bod
Sweet bod

And clanking chains

I say "vanished"
To underground

And I have feet
I'll never die (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I am a freak

But I am the eighth wonder
Eighth wonder of the world
You'll never get to see
What in the name of God can I be?

ANCIENT ALEINS:

My mind's this cave
So dark, no moon, no stars
No sound
Just hearts and walls of art
Strange things happen
For no reason
That's all I know
My mind's this cave
So dark, no moon, no stars
No stars, no sound
Just hearts and walls of art
These creatures I've seen
Some of them edible, some of them mean
That's all I know
I'm not like you
You fly, you burn my eyes
My eyes, you speak in my mind
Your kind all died when you arrived
I saw you making fire
Strange things happen
For no reason at all
I can't help you (I can't help you)
You're not human (you're not, you're not human)
You're not animal (you're not, you're not animal)

SOFT FUZZY MAN:

Cold and windy
Dark and stormy
Let me float your way
Please don't ignore me
What you girls really need's a soft, fuzzy man
(An ambient man)
A trick of the light to love you tonight
You don't understand, there's nothing quite like a soft, fuzzy man
Can't you see me?
Why can't you see me?
I'm all around, all cold and dreamy
What you girls really need's a soft, fuzzy man
(A wisp of smoke man)
To waft over you and cloud up your view
So show me your hands and wave them right through a soft, fuzzy man
Although I have no arms to hold you in a human passion burns within me
I need to feel like I exist
So please baby, please baby, step into the mist
Don't be nervous
No, don't be nervous
I'm not like other guys who have a surface
What you girls really need's a soft, fuzzy man
(An atmospheric man)
A shimmering puff of indistinct love
What's better than the vague embrace of a soft, fuzzy man?
Who seeps through your thoughts
Who makes you see spots
Who blows through the air
Who plays with your hair
I know it sounds crazy, but once you go hazy, you'll understand
I'm your soft, fuzzy man

AS YOUR FATHER I EXPRESSLY FORBID IT:

Jesus Christ, better learn how to forage
Utilities and mortgage are all that will survive
I wish my life was on a graph
So I knew how much left I have to earn tonight

I think about my self a lot 'cause it's the only one I've got
I've earned this life
What have I done to earn this life?

REAGANOMICS:

In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem
Government is the solution to our problem

Chop, chop! Don't want to be late
Lift up and carry your weight
You've got no choice but to dance in a spiral of ants
True bugs might laugh in your face

Now you remember where you're going (To a spiral of ants)
You've got to keep it flowing
You are one ant
(Over, over, over)
Over and over
The pheromones, the overwhelming harmony
Consuming the colony
Creating its own gravity
Before we knew it we became a hurricane
And the bugs who laughed got blown away
As we proclaimed:
The Circle rules your life
